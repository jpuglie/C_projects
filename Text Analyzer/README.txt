The purpose of this program is a text analyzer that executes several different functions including
   word count, letter count, finding words with the string "ous", finding words
   that were not in the dictionary, finding words only made up of "aceslmtw", and counting the number of each 
   length of word.
   
  Included in the folder is also a short book (and speech) by Smedley Butler called War Is a Racket. This book has been
  divided into multiple text files for the project so that the program can iterate through each sized file instead of trying to preform everything at once.
  Also included in the folder is a standard dictionary that has been turned into a text file, this is for the program to cross reference in order to check for words that 
  do not appear in the dictionary.
